- `prospective_renter` — renter preferences (move‑in date, location, budget)  
- `address` — shared across agents/renters/credit cards  
- `renter_address` — maps renters to addresses  
- `credit_card`, `user_cc`, `credit_card_address` — normalized payment structure  
- `property`, `manages` — property listings and agent associations  
- `booking` — stores rental periods, payment method, and status

## ✅ Getting Started

1. Compile:  
   ```bash
   javac -cp ".:postgresql-42.7.3.jar" *.java   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   java -cp ".:postgresql-42.7.3.jar" Main

## 🚀 Use Cases

- A renter signs up, adds multiple addresses, and links their credit cards to billing addresses
- An agent signs up, lists new properties for rent, and updates pricing
- Role enforcement prevents misuse (e.g. renters modifying properties)
